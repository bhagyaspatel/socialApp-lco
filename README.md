# socialApp-lco

## A simple app for learning backend development to understand how routing works.

### A very basic hardcoded api which returns the username, followers and the following of the user of instagram, linkdin and github.

Learned how to create a api, pushing it to heroku and use swagger to write documentation for the api

The app is live in production at : "https://lcobhagya.herokuapp.com/" and can be accessed using following different routes :
"https://lcobhagya.herokuapp.com/api/v1/instagram" , "https://lcobhagya.herokuapp.com/api/v1/linkdn" , "https://lcobhagya.herokuapp.com/api/v1/github".
